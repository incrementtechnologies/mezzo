        <b> HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Your personal data is processed by us and/or our service providers only
        for the period necessary for the purposes for which the information is
        collected. Generally, we will keep your personal data for up to 24
        months from the date of collection and will be for as long as you are a
        customer, although we may keep it longer in order to respond to any
        questions or complaints. When we no longer need to use your information
        for those purposes, we will remove it from our systems and records or
        take steps to anonymize it so that you can no longer be identified from
        it (unless we need to keep your information to comply with legal or
        regulatory obligations to which we are subject).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> YOUR RIGHTS </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), your rights
        under data protection laws in relation to your personal data are briefly
        summarised below. You can exercise these rights by emailing us at
        info@mezzohotel.com or by writing to us at Marketing Department, Mezzo
        Hotel, F. Cabahug cor. Pres. Quezon St., Mabolo, Cebu City 6000

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data
          subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the
          personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully
          processing it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This
          enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about
          you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new
          data you provide to us.
        </li>
        <li>
          Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to
          delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us
          continuing to process it. Please note, however, that we may not always
          be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal
          reasons which we will tell you about, if applicable, after receiving
          your request.
        </li>
        <li>
          Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a
          legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something
          about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
          processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental
          rights and freedoms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Request restriction of processing of your personal data. You can ask
          us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following
          scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b)
          where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase
          it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer
          require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal
          claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need
          to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.
          We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your
          personal data in a structured, electronic, machine-readable format.
          Please note that this right only applies to automated information
          which you initially provided consent for us to use (such as for direct
          marketing communications) or where we used the information to perform
          a contract with you (such as to manage your booking).
        </li>
        <li>
          Withdraw consent at any time if we are relying on your consent to
          process your personal data (e.g., to conduct direct marketing and for
          our use of cookies). This won’t affect any processing already carried
          out before you withdraw your consent or processing under other
          grounds. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide
          certain products or services to you.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm
        your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to
        exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure
        that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to
        receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information
        in relation to your request to speed up our response.
      </p>
